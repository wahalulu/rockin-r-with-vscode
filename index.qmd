## Thank you, AI

::: notes
- not an AI talk, but I work with this every day
- It's a great tool for certain tasks
- Given what's been going on in the world, it's been hard to concentrate
- Prompt: write a detailed outline with summary bullets for 20 slides for a presentation on using R with VSCode (also helps with ADD)
- Used Bing Chat Enterprise

- On April 14, 2016, VSCode graduated from the public preview stage and was officially released to the Web.
- Most of VSCode's source code is available on GitHub under the permissive MIT License.
- The binary releases by Microsoft are freeware and include proprietary code.
- A community distribution, called VSCodium, is maintained, which provides MIT licensed binaries.

## Why VSCode


- multiple languages {{< fa brands r-project >}}, {{< fa brands python >}}
- remote compute w/o having to configure server
- extensions
  - VSCode extensions are primarily written in TypeScript. However, since VSCode is built with Electron, you can write an extension in JavaScript, or anything that can be transpiled to JavaScript, such as TypeScript. For example, the HTML Language Client and PHP Language Client are normal VSCode extensions written in TypeScript.

## My VSCode User Settings

Press {{< kbd F1 >}} (all OS's), {{< kbd mac=Shift-Command-P >}} ({{< fa brands apple >}}), or {{< kbd win=Ctrl-Shift-P >}} ({{< fa brands windows >}}) to open the Command Palette, then select `Preferences: Open User Setting (JSON)`.

```json
{
    // Editor Specific Settings .
    "editor.fontSize": 14,
    "editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14,
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,
    // R Specific Settings
    "r.plot.useHttpgd": true,
    "[r]": {
        "editor.formatOnType": true,
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    // "editor.defaultFormatter": "REditorSupport.r"
    },
    "r.sessionWatcher": true,
    "r.rterm.option": [
        "--no-save",
        "--no-restore",
        "--no-restore-history",
        "--no-site-file",
        "--quiet"
    ],
    // If using radian:
    "r.bracketedPaste": true, //ensures the command chunk can be correctly sent to radian.
    "r.rterm.mac": "/Users/marck/miniforge3/bin/radian",
 
}
```

::: notes
- `r.alwaysUseActiveTerminal` ensures that pressing Ctrl (Command) + Enter will always send to the active terminal rather than trying to create an R terminal if there is none.
- `r.bracketedPaste` ensures the command chunk can be correctly sent to radian.
- r.sessionWatcher enables R session watcher for better interactive functionality.
